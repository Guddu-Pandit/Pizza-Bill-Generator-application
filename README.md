This Java project is a console-based Pizza Bill Generator application. It allows users to select from various pizza types (Veg, Non-Veg, Delux Veg, and Delux Non-Veg), add extras like cheese and toppings, and choose takeaway packaging. The program calculates and displays the total bill, factoring in the base prices and any additional charges for extras and takeaway. The project demonstrates basic object-oriented programming concepts, including inheritance and encapsulation, to manage different pizza types and their associated billing logic.
